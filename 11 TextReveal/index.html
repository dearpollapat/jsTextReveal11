          Scientists' research has revealed that viruses are by far the most
          abundant life forms on Earth. There are a million times more viruses
          on the planet than stars in the universe. Viruses also harbor the
          majority of genetic diversity on Earth. Scientists are finding
          evidence of viruses as a planetary force, influencing the global
          climate and geochemical cycles. They have also profoundly shaped the
          evolution of their hosts. The human genome, for example, contains
          100,000 segments of virus DNA.

          Piedmont, or mountain, glaciers are found in many parts of the world.
          In North America they are distributed along the mountain ranges of the
          Pacific Coast from central California northward. They abound in the
          Andes range in South America and are familiar and greatly admired
          spectacles in the Alps, the Pyrenees, the Caucasus Mountains and the
          mountains of Scandanavia. Rivers of ice flow down the valleys of
          various Asian mountain ranges, including the Himalayas, the Hindu
          Kush, and the Karakoram and Kunlun ranges. They are also a feature of
          the Southern Alps of New Zealand and are found in the lofty mountains
          of New Guinea. The largest piedmont glaciers are the Malaspina and
          Bering glaciers, both in Alaska.

          When mice are kept at high population densities, their behaviour
          changes in a number of ways. Aggressive activity within populations of
          mice rises as density increases. Cannibalism of young also goes up,
          and so does aberrant sexual activity. Communal nesting, frequent in
          natural mouse populations, increases abnormally. In one example, 58
          mice one to three days old (from several litters) were found in one
          nest, most unusual communal living. None survived because most of the
          mothers deserted them immediately after birth.
